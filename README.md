## Features :

- Totem of Undying Revamp/Rework :

Totems of Undying are really cool, it saves you from you dumb fall into that chasm you haven't seen while travelling. But they could be cooler...

The totem of undying has now the ability to teleport you to a lodestone (togglelable in the config file). Similar to a compass, you can right-click on a lodestone with your totem to link it.
Once it is linked, it will have the enchantment glow and the tooltip will display relevant information such as lodestone position **AND** dimension.

Now, when you "die" with a linked totem in hand (main or offhand), not only it will save you from death, it will also teleport you to the location of the lodestone. However, if the lodestone is destroyed, you'll see that the totem will lose its glint signifying that it has been unlinked.

As a visual indicator, the totem will have a different look depending on the dimension it is linked :

- Configurable Item Despawn Delay :

By default, items take 5 minutes (6000 ticks) before despawning. It is there to prevent lag with item entities. *What if I don't care ???*

Look no further ! With this mod you can now choose how long items will take before despawning. You can modify this in the "anku_config" file or by using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) :

- Enchantment : Permanance (max : 3)

Permanance is a new treasure enchantment (currently also available in trading with librarians) that will increase the duration before the item expires.

- *Level 1* : **x2**
- *Level 2* : **x2.5**
- *Level 3* : **x4**

The duration will also change based on the item despawn delay you selected but by default it will be **10, 12.5 and 20 minutes**.

This enchantment is applicable to armor pieces and tools/weapons.
